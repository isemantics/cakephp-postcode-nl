# Zipcoder
Address autofill/autocomplete and distance calculation for Dutch postal codes

# Get the zipcode data
Currently, this plugin is only used for Dutch zipcodes. This might change in the future, if
people request such thing. The Dutch zipcodes are in the public domain for some time and
one example of a website that publishes those zipcodes, is: www.postcodedata.nl (I'm not in
anyway associated with that website). 

* Download the full SQL data file from the website (www.postcodedata.nl)
* Use the CREATE DATABASE SQL below to create the table 'zipcodes' for CakePHP
